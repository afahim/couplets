    description="Considering its unusually large scale, scholars have suggested that this painting of an embracing couple may have once served as a model for wall painting. No text is found on the painting to aid in the identification of the couple, but they have been compared to legendary lovers of Persian literature, including the characters of Khusrau and Shirin, known from the poet Nizami’s Khamsa (Quintet)."
