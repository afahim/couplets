    description="Nuclear Couple plays on the double meaning of the term to devastating effect, adding a red rash signifying radiation poisoning to the smiling faces in an appropriated image of a happy couple reminiscent of 1950s TV situation-comedy characters. The image is a deceptively simple howl of protest that cleverly interweaves two aspects of Ronald Reagan's first term: renewed fears of a nuclear holocaust not felt since the Cold War and the reactionary reassertion of family values after a decade of advances in feminism and gay rights."
