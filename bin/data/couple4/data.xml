    description="This portrait represents a husband and wife of the Gozzadini family of Bologna; the family's coat of arms appears prominently in both paintings. Probably made to celebrate a betrothal or marriage, the portraits contain numerous allusions to love and matrimony, such as the spray of flowers, known as pinks, held by the male sitter, and the fruit (perhaps a quince) held by his wife."
