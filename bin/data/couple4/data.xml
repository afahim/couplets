    description="A visitor to the Wolfe home described the flirtatious duo in Springtime as in the most dangerous and inflammable of the teens... The cunning eagerness with which the maid looks right into the boy’s eyes is modern in meaning and antique in dress; hence the acceptability of this Arcadian idyll, peppered with French spice."
