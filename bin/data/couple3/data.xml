    description="In 1939, Klee compsed twenty-nine works that feature angels, having in earlier years only sporadically depicted them. His angels were not the celestial kind but hybrid creatures beset with human foibles and whims. Klee's angels are forgetful, still female, ugly, incomplete, or poor - as the titles he gave these pictures indicate."
