    description="The development of the painter's style can be traced by a comparison of paintings from different stages in his career. An early signed painting of his of a seated Fath 'Ali Shah demonstrates a profound interest in the detail of jewelled surfaces and patterning, but little modelling or shading. A slightly later pair of paintings of acrobats, attributed to him is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Painted with a warmer palate closer to that of his later works, and with very slight shading in parts, they still give the impression of a flat patterned surface."
