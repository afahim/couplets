    description="Deepening the charm of the scene is the implicit eroticism of the first stirring of young love, as the couple's eyes meet. Felicitous seasonal symbolism disguised as a natural setting appears in the glimpse of flowering prunus above the wall of fresh bamboo. These are spring's first blossoms and herald the beginning of the year, which coincided with the first day of spring according to the lunar calendar used in Japan until the end of the Edo period."
