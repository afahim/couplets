    description="Krishna and Radha gaze into each other’s eyes during a sunset walk between flowering trees. A multitude of birds throng the boughs and the foreground stream, and palm trees seem to explode on the horizon. The lovers’ bodies and garments, like the floral garlands they hold, appear suspended in motion, while the setting vibrates to their ecstasy. This quintessential Indian idea—that nature echoes the passions—is beautifully manifested in this work by a master who has successfully translated emotion into visual delight."
