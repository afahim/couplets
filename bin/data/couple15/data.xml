    description="Burne-Jones associated this painting with a refrain from a Breton folk ballad: Alas, I know a love song, / Sad or happy, each in turn. Drawing inspiration from the gothicizing Pre-Raphaelite movement, the artist conjured a twilight scene with a richly romantic, medieval air, enhanced by allusions to Italian Renaissance art, from the warm, dewy colors to the gracious figures and original frame, which recalls sixteenth-and-seventeenth-century Venetian designs. When the picture was first exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery, London, in 1878, the novelist Henry James admiringly compared it to some mellow Giorgione or some richly-glowing Titian."
